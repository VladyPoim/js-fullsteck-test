# Getting Started with Node App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

It downloads and installs all packages listed there.
Packages are installed into a node_modules directory in your project root.

### `npm run test`

To run the tests, use the following command:

### `npm start input.json`

The program will read the operations from the input file, process each operation, and print the calculated commission fees to the standard output.
